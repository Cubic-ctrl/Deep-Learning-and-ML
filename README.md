# Hate speech detection
 Through this project we detect hate speech from social media data and create models to automatically detect and remove the speech's.

We will use Python and data science libraries such as pandas, Matplotlib and Numpy for analysis of the data.

The project aims to create machine learning models for detecting hate speech in minor languages.
